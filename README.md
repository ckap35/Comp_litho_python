# Compuational lithography (gradient based optimzation) 
This project implements equations found in Computational Lithography (Xu Ma, Gonzalo R. Arce) (https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Computational+Lithography+-p-9780470596975)

Using gradient based descent and Abbe imaging, we find a source-mask combination which can print a given pattern to target.
